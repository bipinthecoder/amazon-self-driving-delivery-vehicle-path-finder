# amazon-self-driving-delivery-vehicle-path-finder
AIM: Implement Amazon’s pathfinding algorithm for Amazon’s self-driving delivery vehicles.
The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y)
and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the
squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
